  <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Privacy Notice for Transition Readiness Dashboard</h1>

  <p class="govuk-body">This notice sets out how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Your Data</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body-l">Purpose</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">The purpose for which we are processing your personal data is to maintain a dashboard of key contacts and policy leads relating to the UK’s exit from the transition period.

  <p class="govuk-body">We will process the following personal data: name, job title, department, work email, and work telephone number. </p>

  <p class="govuk-body-l">Legal basis of processing </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">The legal basis for processing your personal data is: </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
      <p class="govuk-body">Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller. In this case that is the function of the Cabinet Office to coordinate transition plans. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p class="govuk-body">It is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, which in this case is your employment contract. This is because you are an authorised point of contact for other authorised/ cleared individuals to make contact to instigate queries and request progress updates to support their own departmental dependencies and deliverables with other government departments.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body-l">Retention</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">The next stage of Transition to full UK independence from EU ends 31 December 2020. When any individual leaves their role the visible data will be removed immediately but retained in secure folders for audit purposes for a further 6 months after departure. The bulk of the data should be retained for 6 months post the end date (31 December 2020) for enquiry and audit purposes only. </p>
